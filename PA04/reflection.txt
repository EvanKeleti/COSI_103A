1. What did you personally do on the project?

Since I worked on the assignment alone, I did all of the work myself. A quick summary is: making the transaction schema; 
creating a router with the transaction routes; adding sorting through query parameters; adding delete and edit functionality;
adding grouping by category; and creating the views for the default table, grouped table, and edit form.

2. How many hours did you work on this project?

I don't remember exactly how long it took me, but it was probably somewhere between 3-6 hours.

3. What (if anything) was most challenging, and why?

A good portion of the time I worked for was spent troubleshooting an error with '$match' in the group by category aggregate 
function. I had to do a lot of googling to figure out why I wasn't able to match the TransactionItems that had the current 
user's ObjectId in the userId field.

The fix was to change the match parameters from this:

{ $match: { userId: req.user._id } }

to this:

{ $match: { userId: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(req.user._id) } }

I am still not fully understanding of the reason why this is necessary, but apparently, unlike in the find() function, $match needs
an explicit cast in order to compare ObjectIds. 

4. What did you learn (if anything) by completing this project?

I learned a lot doing this project. It was my first time working with JavaScript, and I also gained more experience with html.
I also gained a better understanding of how routes work, and how the browser interacts with a server through requests and 
responses. For example, now that I understand the three common ways of sending information to the server from the browser
(forms, URL parameters, and query parameters), I can now notice these three methods in action on the various websites I visit.
