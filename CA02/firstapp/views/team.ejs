      Since I worked on this project alone, I'm the only team member! I'm a rising somphomore majoring in computer
      science at Brandeis University. I'm 19 years old, and my hobbies are reading and learning new things (when I have the
      motivation). After finishing this assignment, I'll be all done with my work for my freshman year. Yay!
